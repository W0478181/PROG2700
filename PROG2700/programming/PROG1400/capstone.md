### **Workplan Phases**  

#### **Phase 1: Project Planning and Team Setup** (6 Hours)  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Form teams and assign roles (e.g., Scrum Master, Developer, Tester, Security Analyst).  
  - Conduct a project kick-off meeting.  
  - Define project scope, goals, and milestones.  
  - Develop a project roadmap and timeline using tools like Trello, Jira, or GitLab.  
  - Establish communication channels (Slack, MS Teams, etc.).  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Project charter.  
  - Work breakdown structure (WBS) and timeline.

#### **Phase 2: Requirement Analysis and Design** (10 Hours)  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Collaborate with stakeholders to gather requirements.  
  - Create user stories and acceptance criteria.  
  - Design application architecture (Django MVC pattern).  
  - Develop ERD and data models for the database.  
  - Design mockups and wireframes for user interface (Figma or Adobe XD).  
  - Develop a DevOps workflow incorporating CI/CD principles.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Requirements document.  
  - System design diagrams (ERD, architecture, workflows).  
  - UI mockups and wireframes.

#### **Phase 3: Development and Implementation** (24 Hours)  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Set up the development environment (Django, Git, Docker).  
  - Create Django models, views, and templates.  
  - Build RESTful APIs for backend functionality.  
  - Implement NetOps best practices: configure infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools like Terraform or Ansible.  
  - Use SecOps techniques to secure the application:  
    - Input validation.  
    - Authentication/Authorization mechanisms.  
    - Encryption for sensitive data.  
  - Follow DevSecOps principles in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab CI, Jenkins).  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Working application with core functionality.  
  - Configured CI/CD pipeline.  

---

#### **Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance** (8 Hours)  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Perform unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.  
  - Conduct security testing (e.g., OWASP ZAP, static/dynamic code analysis).  
  - Perform load and performance testing.  
  - Address bug reports and implement fixes.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Test cases and results.  
  - Documentation for testing processes.  
  - Refined application ready for deployment.  

---

#### **Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring** (6 Hours)  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Deploy the application to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean).  
  - Set up logging and monitoring tools (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus, Grafana).  
  - Conduct a live demonstration of the deployed application.  
  - Ensure post-deployment security audits.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Deployed application URL.  
  - Monitoring and logging dashboard.  

---

#### **Phase 6: Project Review and Presentation** (6 Hours)  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Prepare project documentation: user manuals, technical reports.  
  - Conduct retrospective meetings to evaluate team performance.  
  - Present the project to stakeholders and instructors.  
  - Collect and integrate feedback.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Final project report.  
  - Presentation slides.  
  - Portfolio entry for the capstone project.
