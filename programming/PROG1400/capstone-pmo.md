   - Bitbucket

Here are some open-source technologies you can use to build your web application with modern DevOps approaches, along with incident management and monitoring tools:

### Web Application Development
1. **Frontend**:
   - **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces¹(https://dev.to/rigdev/4-open-source-technologies-every-true-full-stack-developer-should-master-33e9).
   - **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
   - **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

3. **Database**:
   - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system¹(https://dev.to/rigdev/4-open-source-technologies-every-true-full-stack-developer-should-master-33e9).
   - **MySQL**: An open-source relational database management system.

### DevOps Tools
1. **Containerization**:
   - **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
   - **Podman**: A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers.

2. **Container Orchestration**:
   - **Kubernetes**: An open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications²(https://www.bdccglobal.com/blog/how-open-source-software-is-shaping-the-future-of-devops/).

3. **CI/CD**:
   - **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server for building, testing, and deploying code.
   - **GitLab CI/CD**: A continuous integration and delivery tool built into GitLab.

### Incident Management
1. **IRIS**: A collaborative digital platform designed for incident response analysts to share complex investigations³(https://dfir-iris.org/).
2. **TheHive**: An open-source and scalable Security Incident Response Platform designed for SOCs and CSIRTs.

### Monitoring Tools
1. **Zabbix**: An open-source monitoring solution for networks, servers, and applications⁴(https://www.zabbix.com/).
2. **Prometheus**: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit⁵(https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/open-source-network-monitoring-tools/).
3. **Grafana**: An open-source platform for monitoring and observability, often used with Prometheus for visualizing metrics⁶(https://www.fosslinux.com/110286/best-open-source-and-free-monitoring-tools.htm).

These tools and technologies will help you build a robust web application while following modern DevOps practices. They also provide comprehensive solutions for incident management and monitoring, ensuring your application remains reliable and secure.
